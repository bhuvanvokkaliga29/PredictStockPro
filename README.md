# PredictStockPro
PredictStockPro is an AI-powered stock forecasting app built with Streamlit and LSTM models. It enables users to input tickers, select date ranges, and visualize actual vs predicted prices with metrics and CSV export, making financial forecasting simple and interactive.

PredictStockPro â€“ AI-Powered Stock Price Forecasting ðŸ’¹

An advanced web application for stock price prediction, built with Streamlit and LSTM-based neural networks.

About the Project

PredictStockPro is designed to forecast future stock closing prices using historical market data and deep learning models.
It offers an intuitive interface where users can input stock tickers manually, set custom date ranges, and visualize both historical and predicted prices in an interactive manner.

Key Features

Manual ticker input for maximum flexibility

Interactive charts with historical closing prices and moving averages

LSTM neural network predictions of stock closing prices

Performance metrics display (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²)

Option to download predictions as CSV

Minimal, high-contrast UI with floating card design

Running the Application Locally

Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher

pip package manager

Steps

Clone the repository or download the source code.

Place the trained LSTM model file keras_model.h5 inside the application directory.

Install dependencies:

pip install streamlit yfinance numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras


Launch the app:

streamlit run app.py


Open the application in your browser (default: http://localhost:8501).

Usage Guide

Enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL).

Choose a custom date range (default: 2018 â€“ present).

Run the prediction.

Explore visualizations of historical and forecasted prices.

Check performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²).

Export results as CSV for extended analysis.
